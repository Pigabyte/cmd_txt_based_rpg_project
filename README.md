# cmd_txt_based_rpg_project
A small single file text based rpg that runs on the cmd. I used this as a gateway to develop some muscle memory on code progression and User Interface methods. (Broken Due to no Saved Data anywhere other than variables, but could easily be fixed with some development hours).
