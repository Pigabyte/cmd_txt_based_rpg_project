# cmd_txt_based_rpg_project
A single file cmd text based RPG_Project, big mess, but that was the idea, to see how far I could go in the Spider Web of not having multiple files reading from other files, but a single long script of code in a single page that just keeps on going.

I got to a very nice state, but next thing in line for this project would 100% be adding some sort of simple local database, because everything works for as long as we are navigating the Menus, as soon as we loop the system, suddenly all variables are re-instated, which isn't good at all.

Some pictures below showcasing some ideas behind the proposed design for the project, which is plug and play and doesn't really need a read-me, prompts are self explanatory.

Another thing that would need to be added to the game at some point is defined 'Game Region' settings, as it stands the game runs line by line in a mess of text and prompts with very basic divisions, for readibility would be nice to have very well set spacings in place for each 'Game Region'.
